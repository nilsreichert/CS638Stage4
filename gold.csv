CREDIT APPROVAL-&#,WDDLJ7DB0CA009512,clean,rwd,53425,,33985,,,,NULL,2012 *Mercedes-Benz* *CLS-Class* CLS550 Offered by: Auto Space Corp ??? (631) 593-0598 ??? $33985  When the Mercedes-Benz CLS first launched in 2004 it was touted as a four-door coupe combining the emotion and charisma of a sleek two-door with the comfort and practicality of a traditional four-door sedan. With it Mercedes established a new tier of elegance within its line-up. For 2012 the CLS arrives for its second act. Still a head-turner the new Mercedes-Benz CLS sedan now trades some of its sensuality and artfulness for a dose of aggression and sporting character. The 2012 CLS550 looks and feels more like a driver's car and is backed by a robust 402-horsepower engine. Not enough oomph for you? An uber-powerful AMG version is also available. Although the Mercedes CLS's disposition has clearly changed a bit the car's exclusivity remains perfectly intact. You'll Like This Car If... The 2012 Mercedes-Benz CLS is for affluent buyers looking for an equal-parts blend of sophistication and dynamism. It is for those who want to enjoy luxury-sedan comforts but who also have the desire to make a bold fashion statement. You will turn more than your fair share of heads with the Mercedes CLS. Guaranteed. What's New for 2012 The 2012 Mercedes-Benz CLS550 brags a meaner more coupe-like design and driving dynamics to match. Ride and handling have both been improved and a more powerful engine has arrived. Within you'll find a better-defined cockpit and a larger roster of tech highlights. Driving the CLS-Class Driving Impressions The 2012 Mercedes-Benz CLS550 is a true driver's car. Power comes from a hearty 402-hp 4.7-liter twin-turbo V8 that allows the sedan to launch strong from the line and accelerate... ... effortlessly in mid-sprint. Passing power is in abundance to say the least. And though there is a 518-hp AMG model on the way ??? MSRP: $94900 ??? it hardly seems necessary. In terms of driving dynamics the Mercedes CLS550 has improved on all fronts. Steering in particular is laser precise putting the CLS right on par with BMW 5 Series and 6 Series cars when it comes to sheer driver control. The new CLS inspires confidence through hard cornering and high-speed lane changes and it feels smaller than it actually is. But when you're not pushing it hard the 2012 CLS assumes a relaxed personality. It offers a smooth ride as it glides along whether on long country sweepers or bumpy city streets. Favorite Features Adaptive Highbeam Assist This innovative camera-based system can detect oncoming vehicles and automatically dip one or both headlight beams while also adjusting their range in order to create the ideal lighting conditions for both you and the oncoming driver. Also enhancing the Mercedes CLS550's lighting package are optional full LED headlamps. Electromechanical Direct-Steer System The 2012 Mercedes CLS550 is the first Benz to have this newly-engineered system. Responsive and precise it is one of the primary reasons for the CLS550's newfound driving dynamics. Beyond its sporting nature the system contributes to the vehicle's overall efficiency by only drawing energy when actual steering is taking place. 2012 Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class Details 2012 Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class photo Interior Inside the 2012 Mercedes-Benz CLS offers all the lavishness and technology one would expect at this price point.

CREDIT APPROVAL-&#,WDDLJ7DB0CA009512,clean,rwd,53425,,33985,,,,NULL,2012 *Mercedes-Benz* *CLS-Class* CLS550 Offered by: Auto Space Corp ??? (631) 593-0598 ??? $33985  When the Mercedes-Benz CLS first launched in 2004 it was touted as a four-door coupe combining the emotion and charisma of a sleek two-door with the comfort and practicality of a traditional four-door sedan. With it Mercedes established a new tier of elegance within its line-up. For 2012 the CLS arrives for its second act. Still a head-turner the new Mercedes-Benz CLS sedan now trades some of its sensuality and artfulness for a dose of aggression and sporting character. The 2012 CLS550 looks and feels more like a driver's car and is backed by a robust 402-horsepower engine. Not enough oomph for you? An uber-powerful AMG version is also available. Although the Mercedes CLS's disposition has clearly changed a bit the car's exclusivity remains perfectly intact. You'll Like This Car If... The 2012 Mercedes-Benz CLS is for affluent buyers looking for an equal-parts blend of sophistication and dynamism. It is for those who want to enjoy luxury-sedan comforts but who also have the desire to make a bold fashion statement. You will turn more than your fair share of heads with the Mercedes CLS. Guaranteed. What's New for 2012 The 2012 Mercedes-Benz CLS550 brags a meaner more coupe-like design and driving dynamics to match. Ride and handling have both been improved and a more powerful engine has arrived. Within you'll find a better-defined cockpit and a larger roster of tech highlights. Driving the CLS-Class Driving Impressions The 2012 Mercedes-Benz CLS550 is a true driver's car. Power comes from a hearty 402-hp 4.7-liter twin-turbo V8 that allows the sedan to launch strong from the line and accelerate... ... effortlessly in mid-sprint. Passing power is in abundance to say the least. And though there is a 518-hp AMG model on the way ??? MSRP: $94900 ??? it hardly seems necessary. In terms of driving dynamics the Mercedes CLS550 has improved on all fronts. Steering in particular is laser precise putting the CLS right on par with BMW 5 Series and 6 Series cars when it comes to sheer driver control. The new CLS inspires confidence through hard cornering and high-speed lane changes and it feels smaller than it actually is. But when you're not pushing it hard the 2012 CLS assumes a relaxed personality. It offers a smooth ride as it glides along whether on long country sweepers or bumpy city streets. Favorite Features Adaptive Highbeam Assist This innovative camera-based system can detect oncoming vehicles and automatically dip one or both headlight beams while also adjusting their range in order to create the ideal lighting conditions for both you and the oncoming driver. Also enhancing the Mercedes CLS550's lighting package are optional full LED headlamps. Electromechanical Direct-Steer System The 2012 Mercedes CLS550 is the first Benz to have this newly-engineered system. Responsive and precise it is one of the primary reasons for the CLS550's newfound driving dynamics. Beyond its sporting nature the system contributes to the vehicle's overall efficiency by only drawing energy when actual steering is taking place. 2012 Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class Details 2012 Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class photo Interior Inside the 2012 Mercedes-Benz CLS offers all the lavishness and technology one would expect at this price point.

CREDIT APPROVAL-&#,WDDLJ7DB0CA009512,clean,rwd,53425,,33985,,,,NULL,2012 *Mercedes-Benz* *CLS-Class* CLS550 Offered by: Auto Space Corp ??? (631) 593-0598 ??? $33985  When the Mercedes-Benz CLS first launched in 2004 it was touted as a four-door coupe combining the emotion and charisma of a sleek two-door with the comfort and practicality of a traditional four-door sedan. With it Mercedes established a new tier of elegance within its line-up. For 2012 the CLS arrives for its second act. Still a head-turner the new Mercedes-Benz CLS sedan now trades some of its sensuality and artfulness for a dose of aggression and sporting character. The 2012 CLS550 looks and feels more like a driver's car and is backed by a robust 402-horsepower engine. Not enough oomph for you? An uber-powerful AMG version is also available. Although the Mercedes CLS's disposition has clearly changed a bit the car's exclusivity remains perfectly intact. You'll Like This Car If... The 2012 Mercedes-Benz CLS is for affluent buyers looking for an equal-parts blend of sophistication and dynamism. It is for those who want to enjoy luxury-sedan comforts but who also have the desire to make a bold fashion statement. You will turn more than your fair share of heads with the Mercedes CLS. Guaranteed. What's New for 2012 The 2012 Mercedes-Benz CLS550 brags a meaner more coupe-like design and driving dynamics to match. Ride and handling have both been improved and a more powerful engine has arrived. Within you'll find a better-defined cockpit and a larger roster of tech highlights. Driving the CLS-Class Driving Impressions The 2012 Mercedes-Benz CLS550 is a true driver's car. Power comes from a hearty 402-hp 4.7-liter twin-turbo V8 that allows the sedan to launch strong from the line and accelerate... ... effortlessly in mid-sprint. Passing power is in abundance to say the least. And though there is a 518-hp AMG model on the way ??? MSRP: $94900 ??? it hardly seems necessary. In terms of driving dynamics the Mercedes CLS550 has improved on all fronts. Steering in particular is laser precise putting the CLS right on par with BMW 5 Series and 6 Series cars when it comes to sheer driver control. The new CLS inspires confidence through hard cornering and high-speed lane changes and it feels smaller than it actually is. But when you're not pushing it hard the 2012 CLS assumes a relaxed personality. It offers a smooth ride as it glides along whether on long country sweepers or bumpy city streets. Favorite Features Adaptive Highbeam Assist This innovative camera-based system can detect oncoming vehicles and automatically dip one or both headlight beams while also adjusting their range in order to create the ideal lighting conditions for both you and the oncoming driver. Also enhancing the Mercedes CLS550's lighting package are optional full LED headlamps. Electromechanical Direct-Steer System The 2012 Mercedes CLS550 is the first Benz to have this newly-engineered system. Responsive and precise it is one of the primary reasons for the CLS550's newfound driving dynamics. Beyond its sporting nature the system contributes to the vehicle's overall efficiency by only drawing energy when actual steering is taking place. 2012 Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class Details 2012 Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class photo Interior Inside the 2012 Mercedes-Benz CLS offers all the lavishness and technology one would expect at this price point.

CARFAX BuyBack Guarantee got you covered. So buy with confidence. Gone are the days of SUVs being the size of a tank and handling like one. This Nissan Murano is a perfect example of how SUVs have evolved into vehicles that are as refined as they are rugged. This low mileage Nissan Murano has barely been touched. It's the next best thing to buying new. More information about the 2011 Nissan Murano: Nissan's Murano stands out as offering one of the most stylish best-trimmed and best-appointed interiors from a non-luxury brand with warm soft-touch materials and color choices than make some other mainstream-brand crossover models seem drab. The Murano's powertrain while not overtly sporty is also one of the smoothest and strongest in the business for typical suburban use--getting ahead at stoplights and making safe quick passes on the highway for example. Ride quality is also worth singling out the Murano has a pretty impressive ride especially with the standard 18-inch wheels without feeling too floaty for a curvy road. Interesting features of this model are > (25 words) Strong torquey engine and smooth CVT excellent ride quality versatile interior layout warm luxuriously trimmed cabin stylish exterior and one-of-a-kind new CrossCabriolet modelMINI Las VegasLas Vegas NV 89146Ask for: Used Vehicle SalesPrimary Phone: (877) 205-73862000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 bad credit truck car cheap used for sale poor credit van SUV mini-van financing 2 door 4 door sedan fwd rwd 4wd full-size mid-size compact clean automatic manual coupe like new  Nissan_Murano_Enter this link to see more images plus all other inventory we have available: http://lyv.cc/W5GLA27FBAFAEA464DBBB650D168074EE06C 14535805 3509141Nissan Murano LE Nissan Murano LE Nissan Murano LE Nissan Murano LE Nissan Murano LE Nissan Murano LE Nissan Murano LE Nissan Murano LE Nissan Murano LE Nissan Murano LE,2011 Nissan Murano,2016-10-07T13:07:17-0700,gas,0.600000024,,,,,,,y

CARFAX BuyBack Guarantee got you covered. So buy with confidence. Gone are the days of SUVs being the size of a tank and handling like one. This Nissan Murano is a perfect example of how SUVs have evolved into vehicles that are as refined as they are rugged. This low mileage Nissan Murano has barely been touched. It's the next best thing to buying new. More information about the 2011 Nissan Murano: Nissan's Murano stands out as offering one of the most stylish best-trimmed and best-appointed interiors from a non-luxury brand with warm soft-touch materials and color choices than make some other mainstream-brand crossover models seem drab. The Murano's powertrain while not overtly sporty is also one of the smoothest and strongest in the business for typical suburban use--getting ahead at stoplights and making safe quick passes on the highway for example. Ride quality is also worth singling out the Murano has a pretty impressive ride especially with the standard 18-inch wheels without feeling too floaty for a curvy road. Interesting features of this model are > (25 words) Strong torquey engine and smooth CVT excellent ride quality versatile interior layout warm luxuriously trimmed cabin stylish exterior and one-of-a-kind new CrossCabriolet modelMINI Las VegasLas Vegas NV 89146Ask for: Used Vehicle SalesPrimary Phone: (877) 205-73862000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 bad credit truck car cheap used for sale poor credit van SUV mini-van financing 2 door 4 door sedan fwd rwd 4wd full-size mid-size compact clean automatic manual coupe like new  Nissan_Murano_Enter this link to see more images plus all other inventory we have available: http://lyv.cc/W5GLA27FBAFAEA464DBBB650D168074EE06C 14535805 3509141Nissan Murano LE Nissan Murano LE Nissan Murano LE Nissan Murano LE Nissan Murano LE Nissan Murano LE Nissan Murano LE Nissan Murano LE Nissan Murano LE Nissan Murano LE,2011 Nissan Murano,2016-10-07T13:07:17-0700,gas,0.600000024,,,,,,,y

It's the next best thing to buying new. More information about the 2011 Nissan Murano: Nissan's Murano stands out as offering one of the most stylish best-trimmed and best-appointed interiors from a non-luxury brand with warm soft-touch materials and color choices than make some other mainstream-brand crossover models seem drab. The Murano's powertrain while not overtly sporty is also one of the smoothest and strongest in the business for typical suburban use--getting ahead at stoplights and making safe quick passes on the highway for example. Ride quality is also worth singling out the Murano has a pretty impressive ride especially with the standard 18-inch wheels without feeling too floaty for a curvy road. Interesting features of this model are > (25 words) Strong torquey engine and smooth CVT excellent ride quality versatile interior layout warm luxuriously trimmed cabin stylish exterior and one-of-a-kind new CrossCabriolet modelMINI Las VegasLas Vegas NV 89146Ask for: Used Vehicle SalesPrimary Phone: (877) 205-73862000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 bad credit truck car cheap used for sale poor credit van SUV mini-van financing 2 door 4 door sedan fwd rwd 4wd full-size mid-size compact clean automatic manual coupe like new  Nissan_Murano_Enter this link to see more images plus all other inventory we have available: http://lyv.cc/W5GLA27FBAFAEA464DBBB650D168074EE06C 14535805 3509141Nissan Murano LE Nissan Murano LE Nissan Murano LE Nissan Murano LE Nissan Murano LE Nissan Murano LE Nissan Murano LE Nissan Murano LE Nissan Murano LE Nissan Murano LE,2011 Nissan Murano,2016-10-07T13:07:17-0700,gas,0.600000024,,,,,,,y

CARFAX BuyBack Guarantee got you covered. So buy with confidence. Gone are the days of SUVs being the size of a tank and handling like one. This Nissan Murano is a perfect example of how SUVs have evolved into vehicles that are as refined as they are rugged. This low mileage Nissan Murano has barely been touched. It's the next best thing to buying new. More information about the 2011 Nissan Murano: Nissan's Murano stands out as offering one of the most stylish best-trimmed and best-appointed interiors from a non-luxury brand with warm soft-touch materials and color choices than make some other mainstream-brand crossover models seem drab. The Murano's powertrain while not overtly sporty is also one of the smoothest and strongest in the business for typical suburban use--getting ahead at stoplights and making safe quick passes on the highway for example. Ride quality is also worth singling out the Murano has a pretty impressive ride especially with the standard 18-inch wheels without feeling too floaty for a curvy road. Interesting features of this model are > (25 words) Strong torquey engine and smooth CVT excellent ride quality versatile interior layout warm luxuriously trimmed cabin stylish exterior and one-of-a-kind new CrossCabriolet modelMINI Las VegasLas Vegas NV 89146Ask for: Used Vehicle SalesPrimary Phone: (877) 205-73862000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 bad credit truck car cheap used for sale poor credit van SUV mini-van financing 2 door 4 door sedan fwd rwd 4wd full-size mid-size compact clean automatic manual coupe like new  Nissan_Murano_Enter this link to see more images plus all other inventory we have available: http://lyv.cc/W5GLA27FBAFAEA464DBBB650D168074EE06C 14535805 3509141Nissan Murano LE Nissan Murano LE Nissan Murano LE Nissan Murano LE Nissan Murano LE Nissan Murano LE Nissan Murano LE Nissan Murano LE Nissan Murano LE Nissan Murano LE,2011 Nissan Murano,2016-10-07T13:07:17-0700,gas,0.600000024,,,,,,,y

Only MINI of Las Vegas could offer you a Hyundai Elantra GT with mileage this low on such a popular vehicle. More information about the 2013 Hyundai Elantra GT: The Elantra GT appeals to those who want a hatchback that's slightly larger and more substantial than subcompact models (like Hyundai's Accent) that's more premium-feeling yet still budget-minded. The new GT also carves out a sportier driving experience compared to the sedan and it competes with the Ford Focus Mazda3 Toyota Matrix and Volkswagen Golf among others. According to Hyundai it has more passenger and cargo space than any of those models. It's also the first Elantra model with a driver knee airbag. Hyundai also boasts that the Elantra GT is the lightest 5-door hatchback in the compact segment--and that contributes to its nimble driving feel and good gas mileage. Compared to the Elantra sedan the Elantra GT has a firmer sport-tuned suspension and it's the first vehicle in this segment to add a feature like the Driver Selectable Steering Mode.

Especially Camrys! This Camry is WAY below $5000! Everyone wants one at this price level and there are very few out there that would take you 100 miles. For a retail dealer to sell any Toyota (or Honda) for under $5000 or less they have to own it at $2000 or less. That's a fact.

We keep costs down by doing our own repair and prep work and most importantly we don't require or seek an obscene profit. This Camry is ready to roll right now.

Only MINI of Las Vegas could offer you a Hyundai Elantra GT with mileage this low on such a popular vehicle. More information about the 2013 Hyundai Elantra GT: The Elantra GT appeals to those who want a hatchback that's slightly larger and more substantial than subcompact models (like Hyundai's Accent) that's more premium-feeling yet still budget-minded. The new GT also carves out a sportier driving experience compared to the sedan and it competes with the Ford Focus Mazda3 Toyota Matrix and Volkswagen Golf among others. According to Hyundai it has more passenger and cargo space than any of those models. It's also the first Elantra model with a driver knee airbag. Hyundai also boasts that the Elantra GT is the lightest 5-door hatchback in the compact segment--and that contributes to its nimble driving feel and good gas mileage. Compared to the Elantra sedan the Elantra GT has a firmer sport-tuned suspension and it's the first vehicle in this segment to add a feature like the Driver Selectable Steering Mode. Interesting features of this model are well-equipped and available in a variety of body styles.
